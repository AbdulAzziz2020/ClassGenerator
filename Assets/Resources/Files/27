{"name":"Sigel","description":"The Keeper of the forbidden forest at Soorga. Sigel is a relentless fighter he has always been. The heart is strong, the mind is pure, that's why this character has the greatest focus. Every attack he made always can be continued with any variant attack, it's almost an infinity battle movement but one time the timing is missing, need to prepare with a defense strategy, by running or avoiding, waiting for a chance to shoot a combo again.","image":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/cards\/27.png","turntable":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/turntable\/27.mp4","promotionalImg":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/promotionalImg\/27.png","external_url":"https:\/\/battleofguardians.com\/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Rarity","value":"God of War"},{"trait_type":"Health","value":"4"},{"trait_type":"Intelligence","value":"4"},{"trait_type":"Attack","value":"4"},{"trait_type":"Birthdate","value":"Ancient Age\n08\/01\/120.000 BC"},{"trait_type":"Birthplace","value":"Soorga"},{"trait_type":"Race","value":"Guardian"}]}
