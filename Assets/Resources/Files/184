{"name":"Urgoz","description":"Scary, Big, and Ugly, Grapple attack from Goz almost cannot be anticipated. Rise from 'Marah' then gain the greatest power from there, that makes this Demon gain the very strong power. Walk speed is very slow, but that's doesn't matter, because this creature has a very big body which means he has a big defense too. Anticipating Goz movement are hit and run strategy, but one time he got the grapple timing. That will be the death of the opponents.","image":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/cards\/184.png","turntable":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/turntable\/184.mp4","promotionalImg":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/promotionalImg\/184.png","external_url":"https:\/\/battleofguardians.com\/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Rarity","value":"Elite"},{"trait_type":"Health","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Intelligence","value":"2"},{"trait_type":"Attack","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Birthdate","value":"Ancient Age \n02\/04\/120.000 BC"},{"trait_type":"Birthplace","value":"Marah"},{"trait_type":"Race","value":"Demon"}]}
