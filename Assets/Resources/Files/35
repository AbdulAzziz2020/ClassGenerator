{"name":"Riya","description":"This character has a unique Variant attack form. Riya's move is like inside the mist. Silent, deep, and very-very unpredictable. Riya is the assassin, which makes her move fast and silently. Easy to use and deadly with a single attack makes to become one of the dangerous characters in this game. The combo is not too long but a single deadly attack is very dangerous to anticipate, even for the characters who have a great defense. Riya always has a way to attack.","image":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/cards\/35.png","turntable":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/turntable\/35.mp4","promotionalImg":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/promotionalImg\/35.png","external_url":"https:\/\/battleofguardians.com\/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Rarity","value":"Legendary"},{"trait_type":"Health","value":"2"},{"trait_type":"Intelligence","value":"4"},{"trait_type":"Attack","value":"4"},{"trait_type":"Birthdate","value":"Primal Age\n03\/12\/18.200 BC"},{"trait_type":"Birthplace","value":"Alasdair"},{"trait_type":"Race","value":"Guardian"}]}
