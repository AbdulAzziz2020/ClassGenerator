{"name":"Spencer","description":"Ambition makes a man blind. That quote is for Spencer Knave, he turns the body to the Advance Cybernetic Battle Suit to create the immortal life also to fight the Guardian and Demon. With fast slashing movement, Knave easily gets close to the enemy with attack and pushes the enemy to corner, with combo combinations. The average walking movement did not make Spencer easy to attack. Because sometimes when the attack comes, this Character can counter it with the right movement.","image":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/cards\/95.png","turntable":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/turntable\/95.mp4","promotionalImg":"http:\/\/miracledev.net\/bog\/promotionalImg\/95.png","external_url":"https:\/\/battleofguardians.com\/","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Rarity","value":"Legendary"},{"trait_type":"Health","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Intelligence","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Attack","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Birthdate","value":"09\/08\/2262"},{"trait_type":"Birthplace","value":"Arcton"},{"trait_type":"Race","value":"Human"}]}
