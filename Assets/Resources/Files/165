{"name":"Valentina","description":"The accident on the Sigma corps (one of David Company) make her little bit freak and has some strang superpower. She's crazy with her move and like to do something freak. The battle style is very chaotic and upredictable. She has no side, between demon, Guardians or Human. Nobody knows what's she's goal. Valentina is not her real name. She trying to hide behind her act. The unpredictable movent is the one of she's specials. All of punch and kick it's far from free style battle. But, some of them are very effective using in the right time. Valentina is presistence attacker, because of that, Valentina is quite hard to defeat.
